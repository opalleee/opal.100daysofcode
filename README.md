## About this project ðŸŽˆ

>Hello, I'm Opal. I'm a second-year student in Thai university. I started this project on 26/01/2023 to encourage my coding skills. Sadly, I cannot study this course and practice coding everyday due to the fact that I have a lot of assignments at university, but I will try my best to continue practicing as much as I can.ðŸŒˆ
